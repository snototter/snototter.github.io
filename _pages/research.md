I'm heading the __Learning, Recognition & Perception (LRP)__ workgroup at the __Institute of Visual Computing (IVC)__, Graz University of Technology.

In 2018, I finished my PhD on visual object tracking - leveraging context information for generic single object tracking, as well as multi-object tracking algorithms.
Currently, my research interests include (multiple) object tracking and detection in both 2D and 3D, human behavior analysis, anomaly detection and video analysis in general.
